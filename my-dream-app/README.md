# My Dream Board üåü

This is a personal motivational dashboard built with React. This application is designed to help you visualize your goals, manage your energy, and stay productive.

## Features

This project is built as a single-page application (SPA) with several key features:

* **üè† Homepage / Vision Board:** A dynamic homepage featuring a 3x3 grid. The center displays a random motivational quote, while the 8 surrounding cells show a randomized, shuffling collage of your personal images.
* **üí™ Motivation:** A full "posts" page built with complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. You can share motivational thoughts, text, and images, and other users can react with multiple emoji types (üëç, ‚ù§Ô∏è, üí°).
* **‚ö° Energy:** An interactive page to track your current energy level. It features a slider that reveals different content based on your input‚Äîfrom activity suggestions (movies, songs, anime) for low energy to inspiring quotes for high energy.
* **‚è∞ Clock:** A multi-functional utility page featuring:
    * A customizable Pomodoro Timer for study/break intervals.
    * A live Digital Clock with multiple themes (light, dark, gradient).
    * A Stopwatch with start, stop, and reset.

## Tech Stack

* **React:** All components, state management (`useState`, `useEffect`), and logic are built with React.
* **React Router (`react-router-dom`):** Used for client-side routing between the Home, Motivation, Energy, and Clock pages.
* **CSS:** All styling is done with custom CSS, including Flexbox, CSS Grid, and animations to create a modern, responsive layout.
